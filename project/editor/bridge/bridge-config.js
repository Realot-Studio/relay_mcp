/**
 * bridge-config.js — settings the engine's builder fills in.
 *
 * DEFAULT_RELAY_URL  The shared relay every user connects through. Users only
 *                    press AI → copy the link into their AI app → Connect.
 *                    (Deploy your own copy from /relay; see relay/README.md.)
 *
 * AI_MINUTES_PER_DAY How many minutes the AI may actively work on a project
 *                    per 24 hours while using the shared relay. Time only
 *                    counts while the AI is actually working (running tools);
 *                    being connected and idle is free. Users who host their
 *                    own relay have no limit.
 *
 * AI_IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS  Pauses up to this long between two AI tool calls still
 *                    count as "working" (the AI is thinking). Longer pauses
 *                    are free.
 *
 * RELAY_REPO_URL     GitHub address of this engine (e.g.
 *                    "https://github.com/yourname/Realot-Studio"). Powers the
 *                    "host the relay yourself" button. Leave empty to let users
 *                    type it in.
